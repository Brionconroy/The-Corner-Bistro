## Agile Methodologie

Agile principles were utilised throughout the planning and development of this project. The tecnoligy used in this project was github issues which were categorised into user storys, seperate out into tasks for various aspects of the project. The issues were then added into a project board through github issues as shown.

I created a user storys template through github issues to layout each user stories containing acceptance criteria. These requirements were altered through the project as things dont always go to plan and new ideas can happen. I also used the MoSCoW method while developing this project this helped to prioritize certian feature ahead of others by using tags on the user storys into three differnt actagorys (Must Haves, Should Have, Could Have). By focusing on the Must Haves first you end up with a MVP (minimuim viable prject) qiucker.
